## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create a responsive order profile card using React.
- Utilize Vite for development and build processes.
- Implement modular CSS using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.
- Utilize props

## My process

### Built with

- React for building the user interface
- Vite for fast development and build tool
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for modular CSS
- Responsive design principles

### What I learned

While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of component-based development with React and improved my skills in modular CSS using the BEM methodology. I also gained hands-on experience with Vite as a build tool, which streamlined the development process.

Here is an example of CSS using the BEM methodology:

```css
.order-summary__title {
    font-size: 23px;
}

.order-summary__plan-box {
    align-items: center;
    padding: 12px;
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue refining my React skills and exploring advanced features and hooks. Additionally, I aim to enhance my understanding of Vite and its capabilities, and further improve my CSS practices and responsive design techniques.
